    <p>The horizon of our industry isn't approaching—it's already here, reshaping everything from client expectations to environmental responsibilities. In these final chapters, you'll step beyond today's best practices into tomorrow's competitive advantages. While others react to change, you'll learn to anticipate it, cultivating the adaptive intuition that distinguishes visionaries from followers.</p>
