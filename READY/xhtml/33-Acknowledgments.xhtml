                This book would not exist without the village that supported it.
            </p>
            <p>
                To <strong>God</strong>, the ultimate Creator, for the gift of vision and the hands to execute it.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the <strong>Basquiat Family</strong>, for keeping me grounded and connected no matter where in the world I am.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the mentors who shared their secrets rather than gatekeeping them—you taught me that there is room for everyone at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                And finally, to you, the reader. Thank you for trusting me with your journey.
